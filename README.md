# Setup-Help
## Minecraft Launcher ðŸŒœ
For optimal use, we recommend the Lunar Client. You can download it at https://www.lunarclient.com/.

>For our own convenience, we will cover the following tutorial with the Lunar Client. However, the installation should be similar in other clients.

## Mods ðŸ”§

To make Minecraft a bit more complex and fun to explore we picked out some mods that will extend the base game. You can download the mods [here](https://github.com/eaglec0de/mcserverv1/tree/4e0d8f4c3089129de55e83cdac17481fe2f6cab7/Mods).

By clicking on the last folder-icon, you open your file explorer. In this folder you can copy the content from the mod-folder you just downloaded.
